# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`../docs/CONTEXT.md`** in the sibling documentation repository.
- **`../docs/adr/`** for decisions that touch the area.
- **`../docs/product/governance/decision-log.md`** and the current sprint.

If the sibling docs repository is absent, use the canonical remote once it is
configured and flag that the shared product contract is unavailable. Do not
create a repository-local replacement.

## File structure

Share-k workspace:

```
Sharek/
├── client/
├── server/
├── ai/
└── docs/
    ├── CONTEXT.md
    └── adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
